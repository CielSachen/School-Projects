A program that processes a graph for its details and traversal sequences. Two implementations of the program are
available: a standard and a bonus implementation. The standard implementation will only get the details of a graph and
its traversal sequences. While the bonus implementation compares two graphs to see if one is a subgraph of the other.
The graphs are parsed from a readable text file, and the graph's details and traversal sequences are written to other
text files.
